Legend: [*] built-in  [ ] excluded  <M> module  < > module capable    Overview
+--------
+Some features may be built directly into busybox.
+Some may be made into standalone applets.  Some features
+may be completely removed altogether.  There are also certain
+parameters which are not really features, but must be
+entered in as decimal or hexadecimal numbers or possibly text.
+
+Menu items beginning with [*], <M> or [ ] represent features
+configured to be built in, modularized or removed respectively.
+Pointed brackets <> represent module capable features.
+
+To change any of these features, highlight it with the cursor
+keys and press <Y> to build it in, <M> to make it a module or
+<N> to removed it.  You may also press the <Space Bar> to cycle
+through the available options (ie. Y->N->M->Y).
+
+Some additional keyboard hints:
+
+Menus
+----------
+o  Use the Up/Down arrow keys (cursor keys) to highlight the item
+   you wish to change or submenu wish to select and press <Enter>.
+   Submenus are designated by "--->".
+
+   Shortcut: Press the option's highlighted letter (hotkey).
+             Pressing a hotkey more than once will sequence
+             through all visible items which use that hotkey.
+
+   You may also use the <PAGE UP> and <PAGE DOWN> keys to scroll
+   unseen options into view.
+
+o  To exit a menu use the cursor keys to highlight the <Exit> button
+   and press <ENTER>.
+
+   Shortcut: Press <ESC><ESC> or <E> or <X> if there is no hotkey
+             using those letters.  You may press a single <ESC>, but
+             there is a delayed response which you may find annoying.
+
+   Also, the <TAB> and cursor keys will cycle between <Select>,
+   <Exit> and <Help>
+
+o  To get help with an item, use the cursor keys to highlight <Help>
+   and Press <ENTER>.
+
+   Shortcut: Press <H> or <?>.
+
+
+Radiolists  (Choice lists)
+-----------
+o  Use the cursor keys to select the option you wish to set and press
+   <S> or the <SPACE BAR>.
+
+   Shortcut: Press the first letter of the option you wish to set then
+             press <S> or <SPACE BAR>.
+
+o  To see available help for the item, use the cursor keys to highlight
+   <Help> and Press <ENTER>.
+
+   Shortcut: Press <H> or <?>.
+
+   Also, the <TAB> and cursor keys will cycle between <Select> and
+   <Help>
+
+
+Data Entry
+-----------
+o  Enter the requested information and press <ENTER>
+   If you are entering hexadecimal values, it is not necessary to
+   add the '0x' prefix to the entry.
+
+o  For help, use the <TAB> or cursor keys to highlight the help option
+   and press <ENTER>.  You can try <TAB><H> as well.
+
+
+Text Box    (Help Window)
+--------
+o  Use the cursor keys to scroll up/down/left/right.  The VI editor
+   keys h,j,k,l function here as do <SPACE BAR> and <B> for those
+   who are familiar with less and lynx.
+
+o  Press <E>, <X>, <Enter> or <Esc><Esc> to exit.
+
+
+Alternate Configuration Files
+-----------------------------
+Menuconfig supports the use of alternate configuration files for
+those who, for various reasons, find it necessary to switch
+between different busybox configurations.
+
+At the end of the main menu you will find two options.  One is
+for saving the current configuration to a file of your choosing.
+The other option is for loading a previously saved alternate
+configuration.
+
+Even if you don't use alternate configuration files, but you
+find during a Menuconfig session that you have completely messed
+up your settings, you may use the "Load Alternate..." option to
+restore your previously saved settings from ".config" without
+restarting Menuconfig.
+
+Other information
+-----------------
+If you use Menuconfig in an XTERM window make sure you have your
+$TERM variable set to point to a xterm definition which supports color.
+Otherwise, Menuconfig will look rather bad.  Menuconfig will not
+display correctly in a RXVT window because rxvt displays only one
+intensity of color, bright.
+
+Menuconfig will display larger menus on screens or xterms which are
+set to display more than the standard 25 row by 80 column geometry.
+In order for this to work, the "stty size" command must be able to
+display the screen's current row and column geometry.  I STRONGLY
+RECOMMEND that you make sure you do NOT have the shell variables
+LINES and COLUMNS exported into your environment.  Some distributions
+export those variables via /etc/profile.  Some ncurses programs can
+become confused when those variables (LINES & COLUMNS) don't reflect
+the true screen size.
+
+Optional personality available
+------------------------------
+If you prefer to have all of the busybox options listed in a single
+menu, rather than the default multimenu hierarchy, run the menuconfig
+with MENUCONFIG_MODE environment variable set to single_menu. Example:
+
+make MENUCONFIG_MODE=single_menu menuconfig
+
+<Enter> will then unroll the appropriate category, or enfold it if it
+is already unrolled.
+
+Note that this mode can eventually be a little more CPU expensive
+(especially with a larger number of unrolled categories) than the
+default mode.
+     This feature depends on another which has been configured as a module.
+As a result, this feature will be built as a module.     Use the arrow keys to navigate this window or press the hotkey of the item you wish to select followed by the <SPACE BAR>.

+to modify that configuration.
+
+If you are uncertain, then you have probably never used alternate

+--------
+Some features may be built directly into busybox.
+Some may be made into standalone applets.  Some features
+may be completely removed altogether.  There are also certain
+parameters which are not really features, but must be
+entered in as decimal or hexadecimal numbers or possibly text.
+
+Menu items beginning with [*], <M> or [ ] represent features
+configured to be built in, modularized or removed respectively.
+Pointed brackets <> represent module capable features.
+
+To change any of these features, highlight it with the cursor
+keys and press <Y> to build it in, <M> to make it a module or
+<N> to removed it.  You may also press the <Space Bar> to cycle
+through the available options (ie. Y->N->M->Y).
+
+Some additional keyboard hints:
+
+Menus
+----------

+   Shortcut: Press the option's highlighted letter (hotkey).
+             Pressing a hotkey more than once will sequence
+             through all visible items which use that hotkey.
+
+   You may also use the <PAGE UP> and <PAGE DOWN> keys to scroll
+   unseen options into view.
+
+o  To exit a menu use the cursor keys to highlight the <Exit> button
+   and press <ENTER>.
+
+   Shortcut: Press <ESC><ESC> or <E> or <X> if there is no hotkey
+             using those letters.  You may press a single <ESC>, but
+             there is a delayed response which you may find annoying.
+
+   Also, the <TAB> and cursor keys will cycle between <Select>,
+   <Exit> and <Help>
+
+o  To get help with an item, use the cursor keys to highlight <Help>
+   and Press <ENTER>.
+
+   Shortcut: Press <H> or <?>.
+
+
+Radiolists  (Choice lists)
+-----------
+o  Use the cursor keys to select the option you wish to set and press
+   <S> or the <SPACE BAR>.
+
+   Shortcut: Press the first letter of the option you wish to set then
+             press <S> or <SPACE BAR>.
+
+o  To see available help for the item, use the cursor keys to highlight
+   <Help> and Press <ENTER>.
+
+   Shortcut: Press <H> or <?>.
+
+   Also, the <TAB> and cursor keys will cycle between <Select> and
+   <Help>
+
+
+Data Entry
+-----------
+o  Enter the requested information and press <ENTER>
+   If you are entering hexadecimal values, it is not necessary to
+   add the '0x' prefix to the entry.
+
+o  For help, use the <TAB> or cursor keys to highlight the help option
+   and press <ENTER>.  You can try <TAB><H> as well.
+
+
+Text Box    (Help Window)
+--------
+o  Use the cursor keys to scroll up/down/left/right.  The VI editor
+   keys h,j,k,l function here as do <SPACE BAR> and <B> for those
+   who are familiar with less and lynx.
+
+o  Press <E>, <X>, <Enter> or <Esc><Esc> to exit.
+
+
+Alternate Configuration Files
+-----------------------------
+Menuconfig supports the use of alternate configuration files for
+those who, for various reasons, find it necessary to switch
+between different busybox configurations.
+
+At the end of the main menu you will find two options.  One is
+for saving the current configuration to a file of your choosing.
+The other option is for loading a previously saved alternate
+configuration.
+
+Even if you don't use alternate configuration files, but you
+find during a Menuconfig session that you have completely messed
+up your settings, you may use the "Load Alternate..." option to
+restore your previously saved settings from ".config" without
+restarting Menuconfig.
+
+Other information
+-----------------
+If you use Menuconfig in an XTERM window make sure you have your
+$TERM variable set to point to a xterm definition which supports color.
+Otherwise, Menuconfig will look rather bad.  Menuconfig will not
+display correctly in a RXVT window because rxvt displays only one
+intensity of color, bright.
+
+Menuconfig will display larger menus on screens or xterms which are
+set to display more than the standard 25 row by 80 column geometry.
+In order for this to work, the "stty size" command must be able to
+display the screen's current row and column geometry.  I STRONGLY
+RECOMMEND that you make sure you do NOT have the shell variables
+LINES and COLUMNS exported into your environment.  Some distributions
+export those variables via /etc/profile.  Some ncurses programs can
+become confused when those variables (LINES & COLUMNS) don't reflect
+the true screen size.
+
+Optional personality available
+------------------------------
+If you prefer to have all of the busybox options listed in a single
+menu, rather than the default multimenu hierarchy, run the menuconfig
+with MENUCONFIG_MODE environment variable set to single_menu. Example:
+
+make MENUCONFIG_MODE=single_menu menuconfig
+
+<Enter> will then unroll the appropriate category, or enfold it if it
+is already unrolled.
+
+Note that this mode can eventually be a little more CPU expensive
+(especially with a larger number of unrolled categories) than the
+default mode.
